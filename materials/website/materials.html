      <h2>Editors</h2>
      <p>
        For writing HTML and CSS, you will need an editor. Popular choices among web designers and developers are <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" title="Sublime editor">Sublime</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom editor">Atom</a>. If you're on Windows, feel free to use Notepad (it's pre-installed). For Linux, <a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html" title="Bluefish editor">Bluefish</a> is a great editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: You can't use MS Word, LibreOffice, Pages, TextEdit, or similar word processing apps. Those apps are adding information to a file that will prevent the correct display of your HTML file.
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>Curious what this means? Open any word or RTF document in an editor and see for yourself :).</small>
      </p>


      <h2>How was that again…? – Resources</h2>
      <p>
        These resources are great when you want to read up on functionalities and extensively used by many developers.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="https://css-tricks.com/" title="CSS-Tricks">CSS-Tricks</a></h3>
      <p>
        CSS-Tricks is _the_ place to go when looking up CSS stuff. It has well written articles, often accompanied by code examples.
        Search the site for whatever you're working on and see for the results.

        These sections are especially recommended:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/" title="CSS-Tricks Almanach">Almanach</a>: Find all the CSS properties</li>
          <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/" title="CSS-Tricks">Videos</a>: Just like the articles, the videos cover all kinds of coding situations, easily explained.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" title="MDN's CSS reference">MDN - Mozilla Developer Network</a></h3>
      <p>
        <small>Note: The headline link sends you straight to the CSS reference</small>
      </p>
      <p>
        The MDN is an extensive pool of knowledge. You can read about everything HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Besides the references (= all the CSS properties, HTML tags, DOM, Web APIs etc.), there are also tutorials for learning web development and working with debug and developer tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, it can sometimes be hard to find the right information. So here are a few quick links:

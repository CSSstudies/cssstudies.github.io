      <section id="target-group">
        <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
        <p>
          The group aims at people who want to learn about HTML and CSS from scratch and then dive into all the details. It is for everyone who wants learn within a group as well as in a coached and guided setup where there is time and space for each and every question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did you always want to learn building websites? Or dabbled around with it a bit, but never really found a good starting point where to continue? Or have a feeling of being overwhelmed? Or feel demotivated learning all by yourself? CSSstudies is for you then.
        </p>
        <p>
          You already know about HTML and CSS? Maybe there are colleagues, friends, family, … for whom the group is suitable. Please spread the word, tell them about it and encourage them to join.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSSstudies shall offer a welcoming and safe environment, aiming to be attentative towards explicit as well as the more subtle toxic behaviours that can put off other people. The group operates under the <a href="http://berlincodeofconduct.org/">Berlin Code of Conduct</a>.
        </p>

      <section id="curriculum">
        <h2>The curriculum</h2>
        <p>
          There will be a curriculum. At first, we will work through <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/" title="Shay Howe's HTML and CSS Tutorial">Shay Howe’s Tutorial</a>, but also spice it up with other tutorials where suitable – such as the <a href="http://cssclass.es/materials" title="CSSclasses materials">CSSclasses materials</a> or <a href="http://learnlayout.com/" title="Website of Learn CSS layout">learn CSS layout</a> or the <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/" title="Flexbox froggy, a flexbox game">flexbox froggy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea for each week is to learn about a certain aspect, clear questions, and then instantly use the knowledge, play around with the options, break stuff, clear questions, rinse &amp; repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general flow for each session is supposed to be like this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recap I: summarize the previous session</li>
          <li>Work through the current chapter, address terminology, concepts, etc.</li>
          <li>Code along, play around, break stuff</li>
          <li>Do all this while addressing questions</li>
          <li>Recap II: Round up what has been addressed during the session</li>
          <li>Preview for the next session</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="topics">
